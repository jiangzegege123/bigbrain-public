# Accessibility Improvements (A11Y.md)

Our application has implemented a number of accessibility (A11Y) features to enhance usability for all users, including those using screen readers or navigating via keyboard.

---

1. **Descriptive Button Labels**

   - All interactive buttons use clear, descriptive text such as "Back to Sessions", "Copy Link", and "Go to Play Page", instead of vague labels like "Click here" or icon-only buttons.

---

2. **Keyboard Navigable Modals**

   - Modal dialogs (e.g., session started modal, result modal, game creation modal) are rendered with proper focusable buttons, allowing users to navigate and interact using only the keyboard.
   - Buttons use standard `<button>` elements, ensuring keyboard and screen reader compatibility.

---

3. **Accessible Error Messages**

   - Error messages are placed directly within the visual flow (e.g., `<div className="text-red-500">Error: {error}</div>`), making them visible and accessible to assistive technologies.
   - We also used clear text contrast (red on white) to improve visibility.

---

4. **Semantic HTML via Native Elements**

   - All user inputs (e.g., buttons, forms) utilize native HTML elements such as `<button>` instead of non-semantic tags like `<div>`, which improves accessibility by default.

---

5. **Sufficient Color Contrast**

   - Text and background colors (e.g., blue button on white background, red error text) have been chosen to meet the WCAG contrast ratio requirement of at least 4.5:1.

---

6. **Copy-to-Clipboard with Feedback**

   - The "Copy Link" feature is implemented using standard browser API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText`) inside a button with visible text. This ensures screen reader users can understand and interact with the copy functionality.

---

7. **Responsive Layout with Meaningful Grouping**

   - Content is structured using visual groupings and spacing (e.g., `div` with `p-4`, `space-y-6`, `grid-cols-2`) which aids screen reader parsing and visual hierarchy for users with cognitive difficulties.

---

8. **Clear Page Headings**

   - Key sections of the page use `<h1>` and `<h2>` headings with appropriate text content, like "Session Results" and "Your Games", providing a clear structure for screen reader navigation.
