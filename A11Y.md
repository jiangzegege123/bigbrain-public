# Accessibility Improvements (A11Y.md)

To ensure our application is accessible to as many users as possible, including those using assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation, we have implemented the following accessibility (A11Y) improvements:

---

### 1. Descriptive Alt Text for Images

- All game thumbnails include meaningful `alt` attributes based on the game name, e.g., `alt="Game Name thumbnail"`, allowing screen readers to describe the image content.
- Fallback content is provided when thumbnails are missing, using icons and centered layout for clarity.

---

### 2. Semantic HTML for Interactive Elements

- All interactive controls such as “Start Game”, “Stop Game”, “Advance Question”, and “Delete” use native `<button>` elements instead of non-semantic `<div>` or `<span>`, enabling full keyboard support and screen reader compatibility.

---

### 3. Accessible Confirmation Dialogs

- Confirmation dialogs (e.g., for deleting a game or advancing the quiz) are built using visible, focusable elements, and placed in the DOM with clear actions like “Yes, Start” and “Cancel”.
- These dialogs are fully keyboard navigable and follow a logical focus order.

---

### 4. Copy-to-Clipboard Feature with Feedback

- The “Copy join link” button gives immediate text feedback ("Link copied!") when clicked, improving user experience and accessibility for screen reader users by providing confirmation of action.

---

### 5. Clear and Informative Button Labels

- All buttons have clear text indicating their purpose, such as “Start Quiz”, “Stop Game”, and “View Sessions”, rather than vague or icon-only actions.

---

### 6. High Color Contrast

- The application uses accessible color schemes, such as blue text on white backgrounds and red error text, to maintain high contrast and meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast guidelines.

---

### 7. Visible Focus Styles

- Interactive elements include visual focus styles (`hover:` and `focus:` Tailwind classes) so keyboard users can track where their current focus is on the screen.

---

### 8. Accessible Error Messages

- Error messages are rendered directly on the screen and use appropriate color and size (e.g., `text-red-500`), ensuring visibility and screen reader compatibility.
- Example: "Error: This game has no questions" is directly placed inside the layout structure and not hidden or behind inaccessible components.

---

### 9. Keyboard Navigability

- All major workflows (starting/stopping sessions, navigating games, confirming actions) are fully operable using the keyboard alone (Tab / Enter / Space).
- There are no unreachable actions hidden behind mouse-only interactions.

---

### 10. Logical Heading and Page Structure

- Page titles like "Session Results" and "Your Games" are implemented using heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), allowing assistive technologies to understand and navigate the document structure more easily.

---

### 11. Use of shadcn/ui Components for Built-in Accessibility

- All major UI components (e.g., modal dialogs, buttons, input fields, tables) are built using the shadcn/ui component library.

- This library is designed with accessibility in mind, providing:

  - Proper ARIA roles and attributes (e.g., role="dialog", aria-label, aria-describedby)

  - Keyboard focus trapping and ESC key support in modals

  - Semantic HTML and built-in screen reader support

- By relying on shadcn/ui, we ensure that the base interaction behavior meets WCAG and ARIA standards without requiring custom accessibility patches.
