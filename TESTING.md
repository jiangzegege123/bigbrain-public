# Test Coverage Goals

Our end-to-end tests aim to:

1. Verify critical user flows work as expected
2. Test integration between different components
3. Ensure data persistence and state management
4. Validate UI/UX functionality
5. Cover error cases and edge scenarios

Each test path focuses on different aspects of the application to maximize coverage while minimizing test overlap.
